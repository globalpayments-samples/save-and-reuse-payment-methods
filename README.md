## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Global Payments account with API credentials ([Sign up here](https://developer.globalpay.com/))
- Development environment for your chosen language
- Package manager (npm, composer, maven, dotnet, go mod)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd save-and-reuse-payment-methods
   ```

2. **Choose your implementation**
   ```bash
   cd dotnet  # or java, php
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your Global Payments GP API credentials:
   # GP_API_APP_ID=your_app_id
   # GP_API_APP_KEY=your_app_key
   # GP_API_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
   ```

4. **Install dependencies and run**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

   Or manually for each language:
   ```bash
   # .NET
   dotnet restore && dotnet run

   # Java
   mvn clean compile cargo:run

   # PHP
   composer install && php -S localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser
